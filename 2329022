Diffrence between DML, DCL and DDL

DML, DCL, and DDL are three categories of SQL (Structured Query Language) statements used for interacting with databases. 
Each category serves a different purpose in managing and manipulating database data and structure:

DML (Data Manipulation Language):
DML statements are used to manipulate data stored in the database.
Common DML statements include:
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
INSERT: Adds new rows of data into a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
DELETE: Removes data from a table.
DML statements focus on performing operations on the data itself, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.
Example DML statement:
sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';

DDL (Data Definition Language):
DDL statements are used to define, modify, or delete database objects like tables, indexes, and constraints. These statements are responsible for defining the structure of the database.
Common DDL statements include:
CREATE: Used to create database objects like tables, views, indexes, and schemas.
ALTER: Modifies the structure of existing database objects, such as adding or removing columns from a table.
DROP: Deletes database objects, such as tables or indexes.
DDL statements are typically executed less frequently than DML statements and are often used by database administrators to design and maintain the database schema.
Example DDL statement:
sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE
);

DCL (Data Control Language):
DCL statements are used to control access to the database and manage permissions and security.
Common DCL statements include:
GRANT: Provides specific privileges (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE) to users or roles for database objects.
REVOKE: Removes privileges previously granted to users or roles.
DCL statements are essential for enforcing security and access control policies within a database.
Example DCL statement:
sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO user1;

In summary, DML deals with manipulating data (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), DDL deals with defining and modifying the database structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP), 
and DCL deals with controlling access and permissions(GRANT, REVOKE). Each category serves a distinct purpose in managing and maintaining a relational database system.
